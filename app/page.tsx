          We're an organization dedicated to making the world a kinder place. We
          achieve this through spreading our message via children's books,
          merchandise, as well as school and library tours that highlight the
          importance and impact of kindness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission is to spread kindness while also raising funds for mental
          health initiatives.
        </p>
        <p>And in the meantime, remember to always be kind.</p>
